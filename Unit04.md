**Unit 4: Current Topics in Computational Biology** <span
id="4"></span> 
*In this final unit, we will shift our focus from theoretical
generalities in computational procedure to specific applications of
Computational Biology in current research.   This unit should provide
you with a better understanding of the ways in which Computational
Biology can applied in research.  We will look at topics in
Computational Biology that have come up in the mainstream media and
study papers that have recently been published in scientific journals.  
  
 Note: The content of this unit will change over time and is dependent
on the contents of the current issue of the journal, or current topics
in the news.   This unit will likely be more of an overview than an
in-depth study; it should expose you to various research methods and
approaches to drawing conclusions from data. *

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 12 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.1.1: 6 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.1.2: 6 hours

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   Provide specific examples of how computational biology is currently
    being used.
-   Identify resources for information on computational biology.
