**Unit 1: Introduction to Computational Biology** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit will serve as your introduction to the basic principles and
procedures of computational biology.  We will begin by discussing the
application of mathematics to biological phenomena and then learn in
detail how computers can be used to create and manipulate mathematical
models.  
  
 How does a scientist extract variables from a natural process in order
to create a predictive mathematical formula and then use that formula to
create a computer program through which he can quickly manipulate
variables to simulate a variety of circumstances within a complex
environment?  You will learn each step of that process here.  Upon
completion of this unit, you should have a clear understanding of the
process of creating a computational model in biology.*
